    <h2 class="myH2">What is the Corona Virus?</h2>
    <p class="myP">
        
        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness
        that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes
        COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during
        an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China.

        The virus that causes COVID-19 probably emerged from an
        animal source, but is now spreading from person to person.
        The virus is thought to spread mainly between people who
        are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)
        through respiratory droplets produced when an infected
        person coughs or sneezes. It also may be possible that a person
        can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has
        the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
        possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main
        way the virus spreads.
